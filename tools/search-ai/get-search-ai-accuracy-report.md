get_search_ai_accuracy_report

## Description

Returns a structured accuracy report showing what each AI engine reports for your business's Name, Address, Phone (NAP), hours, and website — and how it compares to your actual data. Results are broken down by location and run date.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `startDate` | string | Yes | — | Start date in `yyyy-MM-dd` format |
| `endDate` | string | Yes | — | End date in `yyyy-MM-dd` format |
| `aiModels` | list[string] | Yes | All three | AI engines to include: `"CHATGPT"`, `"GEMINI"`, `"PERPLEXITY"` |
| `businessNumbers` | list[integer] | Yes | — | Location IDs to include (from [get\_child\_locations](../business/get-child-locations.md)) |
| `pageSize` | integer | No | `100` | Results per page |
| `startIndex` | integer | No | `0` | Start index for pagination |

## Example Usage

```
How accurately does ChatGPT report my business information for all locations?
```

```
Show me the NAP accuracy report for my Downtown location from the last Search AI run.
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "locationId": "78901",
      "locationName": "Acme Dental – Downtown",
      "runDate": "2026-06-20",
      "aiModel": "CHATGPT",
      "reportedName": "Acme Dental",
      "reportedAddress": "123 Main St, Austin, TX 78701",
      "reportedPhone": "+15125550100",
      "reportedHours": "Mon–Fri 8am–6pm",
      "reportedWebsite": "https://acmedental.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notes

- `businessNumbers` is required — pass location IDs from [get\_child\_locations](../business/get-child-locations.md).
- Compare reported values against your actual data to identify what AI engines are getting wrong.
- Use [get\_search\_ai\_available\_runs](get-search-ai-available-runs.md) to find valid `startDate`/`endDate` values.
