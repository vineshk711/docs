title: "Get Child Locations"
description: "Fetch all child locations of the current enterprise account."
---

```
get_child_locations
```

## Description

Returns the full list of child locations under the authenticated enterprise (parent) account. Each location includes its ID, name, and alias.

This tool is a prerequisite for any **location-level tool** — tools that operate on a single location require a `locationId` from this list.

## Parameters

None. Locations are resolved automatically from the authenticated session.

## Example Usage

```
How many locations do I have and what are their names?
```

```
List all my locations with their IDs.
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "locations": [
    { "id": "78901", "name": "Acme Dental - Downtown", "alias": "acme-dental-downtown" },
    { "id": "78902", "name": "Acme Dental - Westlake", "alias": "acme-dental-westlake" },
    { "id": "78903", "name": "Acme Dental - Cedar Park", "alias": "acme-dental-cedar-park" }
  ]
}
```

## Notes

- Call this tool first when using any location-level tool such as [get\_listing](../listings/get-listing.md) or [get\_listing\_location\_status\_report](../listings/get-listing-location-status-report.md).
- Enterprise accounts may have hundreds of child locations. The full list is returned.
