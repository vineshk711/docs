## Overview

The Birdeye MCP Server uses **OAuth 2.0 with Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)**. When you connect your AI client, it automatically negotiates credentials and walks you through a one-time browser-based login with your Birdeye account.

You never need to copy API keys or manage tokens manually.

## How It Works

1. **Client discovers the server** — Your AI client connects to `https://mcp.birdeye.com/mcp` and discovers the OAuth configuration automatically.
2. **Dynamic client registration** — The client registers itself with Birdeye. This happens automatically — no manual setup required.
3. **Browser authorization** — You are redirected to a Birdeye login page to sign in and grant access.
4. **Token issued** — After approval, an access token is issued to your AI client. All subsequent MCP requests use this token.
5. **Business context resolved** — Every tool call is scoped to the Birdeye business associated with your account. Enterprise accounts with multiple locations automatically have access to all child location data.

## Authorized Redirect URIs

The ChatGPT and Claude AI clients are pre-authorized for OAuth redirects.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are using an MCP client other than ChatGPT or Claude, you must register it with Birdeye by providing your redirect URI to Birdeye Support.
{% endhint %}

## Scopes

The Birdeye MCP Server requests the following OAuth scopes:

| Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `openid` | Verify your identity |
| `profile` | Access your name and profile info |
| `email` | Identify your Birdeye account |

No write access to your Birdeye account is requested or granted. All tools are **read-only**.

## Data Privacy

- All tools are annotated as read-only — the server never modifies your Birdeye data
- Sensitive fields such as reviewer email addresses are automatically filtered from responses
- OAuth state is encrypted at rest using symmetric encryption

## Revoking Access

To revoke access, disconnect the integration from your AI client's settings. Your Birdeye account data is not affected.
